## README

This is a python script that can be used to search through the Arch Wiki Documentation Offline using the arch-wiki-docs package as well as the dmenu utility. 

I wanted to create something like this because on long flights without access to the internet if I came across an issue or had a question I would have to wait to browse the docs. 

### Installation:

On your arch system use pacman to install the arch-wiki-docs package.
`sudo pacman -S arch-wiki-docs`

The docs will be saved into /usr/share/doc/arch-wiki/


Clone the repository to download the script.
`git clone (https://github.com/zekesarosi/arch-wiki-docs/)` 

Change directories into the cloned repository.
`cd arch-wiki-docs/`

Mark the 'run_setup.sh' script as executable.
`chmod +x run_setup.sh`
